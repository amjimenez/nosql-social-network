## NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Description
The challenge is to build an API for a social network application. It will allow the users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. We will be using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. We may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of our choice. This application will not be deployed so a video will be provided to demonstrate the challenge.

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository.
2. Run the command ```npm install``` to download the packages.
3. Then run the command ```npm start``` to run the software.
